  <h1>Grace Hopper</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
      <span class="name">Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray)</span> was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.</p>

    <p>One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularised the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to
      the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</p>

    <p>quotes by Grace Hopper</p>

    <blockquote>
      "If it is a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than to get permission."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 'We've always done it this way'."
    </blockquote>

      Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. </p>
    <p>

      Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was
        possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. </li>


      <li>By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. </li>



      <li>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. </li>
      <li>In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on
        English words. </li>
      <li>In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace". </p>
    <p>The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.</p>
    <p>During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honour.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      On New Year's Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington, Virginia; she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. </p>
