    <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace(née Byron)</span> was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.<p>

          She was the first to
          recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential
          of a
          <span class="em">"computing machine"</span> and the first computer programmer.

      <p>Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella "Annabella" Milbanke, Lady Wentworth.All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. </p>
      <p>Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later.He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins:</p>
      <blockquotes class="em">"Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"</blockquotes>.
      <p>He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old.</p>
      <p>Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained
        interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request.She was often ill in her childhood. </p>
      <p>Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and Ada in turn became Countess of
        Lovelace.</p>
      <p>Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as <span class="em">Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday</span> and the author <span class="em">Charles Dickens</span>,
        which
        she used to further her education.Ada described her approach as <span class="em"> "poetical science" </span> and herself as an <span class="em">"Analyst (& Metaphysician)" </span>.</p>
      <p>When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician <em>Charles Babbage</em>, also known as <em>"the father of computers"</em>, and in particular,
        Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.</p>

      <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called <em>Notes</em>. These notes contain what many consider to be
        the first
        computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers.</p>
      <p>She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or
        number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of <em>"poetical science"</em> led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how
        individuals
        and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.
